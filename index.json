I have a strong interest in data-oriented and object-oriented programming design, aimed at analysing data sets of large size and developing simulations. My current activity is focused on analysing the data collected by the experiment from 2011 to 2018, in particular searching for rare charm decays and studying their physical properties, using state-of-the-art data analysis tools and techniques, from parallel computing to advanced machine learning. During my PhD activity I worked also on electronics radiation hardening, data acquisition and readout electronics test for the upgrade of the LHCb muon subdetector, upgrade that is currently ongoing in order to reach high luminosity in proton-proton collisions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dbrundu.github.io/author/davide-brundu/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/davide-brundu/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Particle Physics, working in the Cagliari group of the LHCb experiment at CERN.

Hydra provides a collection of containers and algorithms commonly used in HEP data analysis, which can deploy transparently OpenMP, CUDA and TBB enabled devices, allowing the user to re-use the same code across a large range of available multi-core CPU and accelerators. The framework design is focused on performance and precision.","tags":null,"title":"Hydra","type":"project"}]
